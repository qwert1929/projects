board game:
There are 2 player.Player 1 moves first.
On each turn, the current player makes two subsequent moves:
• Moving his piece to one of its eight neighbors. He can move it vertically, horizontally,
or diagonally. He can’t move it to a removed square, outside of the board, or to his
opponent’s square.
• He can remove a square from the board. It can’t be an already removed one or a square
with a piece on it.
The board is shared between both players. If one player removes a square, he also can’t move
his piece to that square.
The game ends when one of the players has no place to move his piece on his turn.
